Evil Connections! similar to the ny times game "connections" i have created a game were you have to guess 4 categorys of words. the twist is... 
mine is evil ðŸ˜ˆ




HOW TO PLAY!
the first thing you will see is a 4x4 grid filled with words
you then enter 4 words you belive belong to the same evil connection
if the guess is correct the word will turn gold
the game will end aftwer you either run out of lives or win the game




installation:
clone repository
go into the evil connections file
run the game
